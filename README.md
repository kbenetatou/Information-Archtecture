Website with recipes and advice on healthy eating without acting as triggers to people that are either recovering from an ED or simply donâ€™t have a healthy relationship with food. Many websites try to advice people on healthy eating by promoting diet plans like Keto or intermittent fasting (IF); plans that doctors and nutritionists alike should approve before one decides to immense themselves in.
My idea would be creating a website with healthy recipes that the user can choose their recipes based on ingredients, types of diet (vegetarian, vegan, pescetarian, etc), time that it takes to cook, etc, as well as providing advice as to how each of us can adopt a healthy lifestyle without allowing it to dictate our lives.
